# Insurance_claim_billing_team

1. Description:
    This project is a Python-based application that calculates insurance payments for healthcare providers 
    and pharmacies. It validates patient, doctor, and diagnosis data, ensuring compliance with 
    CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) standards and provides a comprehensive report 
    on payments and any rejections.

    The primary goal is to streamline the insurance payment process and reduce errors in healthcare
    claims by implementing robust validation checks and calculations.

    ~ Clone the Repository

    ~ git clone https://github.com/your-repo/insurance-payment-calculator.git
    ~ cd insurance-payment-calculator
    ~ Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)

    python -m venv env
    ~ source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ~ Install Required Packages Install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file:
        - pip install -r requirements.txt

    ~ Ensure Data Files Are Present Make sure the following CSV files are in the project directory:
        - CMS_CPT_ICD.csv
        - doctor_data.csv
        - patient_coverage.csv
        - drugs_data.csv
    ~ Run the Script Execute the script using Python: 
        - python main.py

4. Features:
    ~ Patient Validation
    - Ensures the patient is covered under a valid insurance plan, determining coverage percentage 
      and eligibility.

    ~ Doctor Validation
    - Verifies that the doctor is active and licensed to provide healthcare services.

    ~ Diagnosis Validation
    - Checks the provided CPT and ICD-10 codes against a CMS-compliant dataset for accuracy.

    ~ Healthcare Provider Payment Calculation
    - Calculates the total payment to the healthcare provider based on valid diagnoses and patient
    coverage rate.

    ~ Pharmacy Payment Processing
    - Validates and computes the payment for prescribed drugs based on patient insurance coverage.

    ~ Detailed Reporting
    - Outputs a JSON file (insurance_payment_report.json) containing:

    ~ Payment details for the healthcare provider and pharmacy.
    - Rejection reasons for invalid entries.

5. Usage:
    ~ Input Data:
    - Patient information (e.g., ID, name, insurance ID).
    - Doctor information (e.g., ID, name, specialization, license number).
    - Diagnosis entries with relevant CPT and ICD-10 codes.
    - List of prescribed drugs.

    ~ Output:
    - A JSON file with payment details and rejection reasons.
